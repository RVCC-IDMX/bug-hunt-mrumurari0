// Bug 1: The Counter That Counts Wrong
// This should count from 1 to 5
// But something is wrong...

BEGIN
    SET counter TO 1

    WHILE counter < 5 DO
        DISPLAY "Count: " + counter
        SET counter TO counter + 1
    END WHILE

    DISPLAY "Done counting to 5!"
END

// Hint: Trace through with counter values. Does it really count to 5?
